I'm an electrical engineer working in the Bay Area for Tesla Motors. I enjoy learning about hardware and software, traveling, meeting new people, traveling, good coffee and beer, and capturing memories to look back on later in life.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn about pretty much anything, so if you want to collaborate on a tech project, let me know! My areas of strength are currently:

* Hardware design and PCB layout (Altium Designer)
* I2C, SPI, UART, CAN, USB design
* Python
* System design
* Sensor integration
* Rapid hardware prototyping using Raspberry Pi and Arduino
* Hardware debugging

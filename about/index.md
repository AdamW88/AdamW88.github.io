I'm an electrical engineer working in the Bay Area for Tesla Motors. I enjoy everything electrical engineering and am always looking to learn more about hardware and software, travel, meet new and interesting people and live life. I am always down for a good cup of coffee or pint of beer, and hope to create amazing memories with friends to look back on later in life.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn about pretty much anything, so if you want to collaborate on a tech project or talk to me about contract work, let me know! My areas of strength are:

* Hardware design and PCB layout using Altium Designer and Eagle PCB
* Power electronics design (AC/DC & DC/DC switch mode power supplies, filters, high voltage battery management and monitoring etc.)
* Microcontroller layout and interfacing using
	* I2C, SPI, UART, CAN, USB design
* Python
* System design
* Sensor integration
* Rapid hardware prototyping using Raspberry Pi and Arduino
* Hardware debugging and diagnostics

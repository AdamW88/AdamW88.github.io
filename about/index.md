I'm an electrical engineer working in the Bay Area for Tesla Motors. I enjoy everything electrical engineering and with a particular interest in virtual/augmented reality, open source hardware/software and embedded systems. Outside of work and tinkering, I like to travel, learn languages and cultures, try new foods and explore the outdoors. I am always down for a good cup of coffee or pint of beer, and hope to create amazing memories with friends to look back on later in life.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn about pretty much anything, so if you want to collaborate on a tech project or talk to me about contract work, let me know! My areas of strength are:

* Hardware design and PCB layout using Altium Designer and the open source version, CircuitMaker
* Power electronics design (AC/DC & DC/DC switch mode power supplies, filters, high voltage battery management and monitoring etc.)
* Microcontroller layout and interfacing using
	* I2C, SPI, UART, CAN, USB design
* Python
* System design
* Sensor integration
* Rapid hardware prototyping using Raspberry Pi and Arduino
* Hardware debugging and diagnostics

The tools I use while designing are:
* Altium Designer
* CircuitMaker
* LTSpice
* Python
* occasionally hacking things together with C :)
* Tons of lab equipment (oscilloscopes, function generators, power supplies, DMMs etc).

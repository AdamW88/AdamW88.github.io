It's been a while since I've last posted on my site, but I'm back now and have tons of ideas for new content. I'll definitely be focusing more on hardware design, break downs, and talking about some of my own projects that I have going on.

Some of the topics I'll be covering in the near future are:
-	Lithium ion/Lithium polymer batteries
-	Charging circuitry and battery monitoring systems
-	Breaking down the iPhone brick charger
-	Switch mode power supplies (AC/DC, DC/DC)
-	Designing my own uninterrupted power supply and battery charger for a RaspberryPi
-	Hack-a-thon ideas and feasibility studies
-	DC Motors and motor control

And lots more. Look forward to sharing all of this with everyone!

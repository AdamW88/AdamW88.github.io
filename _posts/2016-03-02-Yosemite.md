<h2>Yosemite National Park 2016</h2>

Recently two more college friends have transplanted into the Bay Area for work: one in tech in the City, and another in nursing. Even though I'm meeting some great people and making all kinds of new friends here in the Bay, it's been really nice having some fellow Texan transplants. They make me feel a little bit more at home.

This past weekend another one of our mutual friends flew into the Bay due to a ridiculously affordable round trip ticket from Southwest ($100 round trip!), and asked if I wanted to go camping in Yosemite. If you read my <a href="http://adamw88.github.io/Goals">Personal Goals</a> post, you'll know that I've been wanting to travel a lot more this year, so I jumped at the opportunity to go.

Growing up in Texas, I had never really seen actual mountains; the closest thing I've ever really seen was the hill country in Austin. As we drove into the Sierras, I was amazed by the sheer size of everything I was seeing. We drove past a sign that said we were about 6,000 feet in elevation; over a mile above the Bay Area! This was also my first time driving on winding mountain roads, and seeing that there weren't many guard rails around was pretty intense...not to mention going around blind corners/hills.

Once we got into the park (for free thanks to JR being an American Hero with his active military ID), we made our first stop at the Bridalveil Falls. We decided to hike in toward the falls, despite a sign warning that the area is dangerous. The rocks were pretty slippery, but the views were well worth the careful trek up toward the falls.

We had some lunch and eventually got a camp spot in Park 4, an area where you just setup a tent where you can find some open ground. With our tent pitched, sleeping bags unpacked and set up, Camp Booger was broken in with an inagural 30 minute nap before hitting the trails.

Once we woke up, 2 hours later, we decided to hike the Mirror Lake trail before the sun went down to get a nice view of Half Dome. When the water on the lake is calm and not moving, you can see a perfect reflection of Half Dome on the surface. Unfortunately, the water was moving pretty quickly on our visit, and Mirror Lake wasn't so mirrory. No worries though, because...

<h2>Half Dome Didn't Disappoint</h2>

You really should view these photos on a big screen to appreciate the beauty of it! These photos were taken with my iPhone 6S, and I was very pleased with the results.

We got some amazing shots while at Mirror Lake, at just took a while to soak in the scene. These photos don't do the majesty and sheer size of the area justice; you really have to go experience it all for yourself.

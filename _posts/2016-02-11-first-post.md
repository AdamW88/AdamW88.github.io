# hello world

I really want to begin documenting my life, goals, work, and memories. I've been wanting to make a tech blog for quite some time, but never really made a conscious effort to. 
That, or I would try to pick up web development, read a bit into something like Ruby on Rails, get lost, and stop caring or get busy doing something else. 
This blog is my attempt to rectify that, and what better a place to do it than Github pages?! I can host my
own site, store my code/PCBs with version control, and *pay absolutely nothing* all in one place? Its the perfect solution to my needs, and Jekyll is a joy to use.

I'm an electrical engineer and techie at heart. I am always trying to learn something new to build cool hardware and software. 
My areas of focus, and thus the focus of this blog, are:

* Hardware/electronics design engineering
* Software engineering
* Teaching others
* Collaboration (start ups etc.)
* Whatever I feel like

But first, a little bit about myself. I'm an electrical engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area working for Tesla Motors. Having moved recently, I'm loving life out in the Bay.
The weather is a significant improvement over Texas, and the fact that I can go hiking, surfing, AND skiing in the same day blows my mind. Public transportation that is actually 
worth a damn is a revelation in my life. The views are unlike anything I've ever seen, and to be able to walk around in Facebook/Google/Apple headquarters is awesome and inspiring. 
There's an entrepreneurial energy here that is definitely absent from Houston. It feels like if you have an idea, you can find people to help you work on it and maybe make it come
to fruition.

That's not to say the Bay Area isn't without its faults. When I interviewed with Tesla, my recuiter, Lauren, asked me if I knew how expensive it is to live out here and if that was okay.
Saying no to Tesla wasn't an option, so I said 'Yeah I know its pretty pricey out there, but its okay!', and at the time it was fine. I just wanted to get out there and start doing
amazing things with a cool company.
